## ++ Hotkeys can now send multiple lines of text

When targeting GTA:SA:MP and a hotkeys finish is ENTER, users can now send multiple lines of text into the chat via one single hotkey.

To trigger this behaviour you need to add "**\n**" after a sentence into your text.

**Example**: A text such as "/engine**\n**/lights" would result in **/engine** and **/lights** being sent into the chat after one another followed by an ENTER.
